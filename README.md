## About datasets

The data consists of daily records per location with variables related to number of confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing, vaccinations and a other variables of potential interest.

Source: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

For more information on the metrics and data: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data 
(the variables description is also included in the dataset folder of this repository)


For the purpose of practing writing more complex SQL queries and creating relational databases I have separated the source's dataset into 3 separate files:

1. Covid Deaths and Cases: containing variables from Confirmed Cases, Confirmed Deaths, Hospitality & ICU, Stringency index, Reproduction Rate and Excess Mortality.
2. Covid Vaccinations and Tests: containing variables from Vaccinations and Test & Positivity.
3. Country Metrics: containing variables specific to each location, such as population size and density.
